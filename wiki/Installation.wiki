To get the latest copy of the code, just perform a checkout from SVN :

{{{
svn checkout http://django-values.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dbsettings/
}}}

= INSTALLED_APPS =

Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting to make sure Django knows about it.

{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'dbsettings',
    ...
)
}}}

= URLconf =

In order to modify your options on the fly, you'll need access to the setting editors, so add it in to your urls.py.

{{{
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    (r'^settings/', include('dbsettings.urls')),
    ...
)
}}}

= Syncing the database =

There is one model that needs to be installed into the database. Just run `syncdb` and the table will be created as normal.

*Note:* This does _not_ have to be done prior to adding settings to your models. If you run `syncdb` _after_ setting up your value attributes, dbsettings won't complain. However, you will definitely need to run `syncdb` before attempting to edit any settings.

= That's it! =

The rest of the work is done in each individual models.py, and is covered under [Usage].
